Fault-injection
===============

Motivation
----------

  - "almost all (92%) of the catastrophic system failures are the result of
    incorrect handling of non-fatal errors explicitly signaled in software.
    [...] in 58% of the catastrophic failures, the underlying faults could
    easily have been detected through simple testing of error handling code." --
